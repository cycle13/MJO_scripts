remap_w500.ncl : remap w500 in netcdf to the grid resolution and grd format of LBM
remap_grd.ncl  : remap mean state (t,q,ps,zg,u,v) in netcdf to the grid resolution and grd format of LBM

get_forc_hist.gs : following remap_w500.ncl, prepare forcing file from remapped w500 used by LBM
get_bs_hist.gs   : following remap_grd.ncl, prepare basic state file used by LBM
